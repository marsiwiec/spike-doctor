# Spike-doctor
Basic Shiny app written in Python for the analysis of whole-cell current clamp recordings focusing mostly on spike detection and supthreshold/suprathreshold feature extraction.

- currently only works with Axon Instruments ABF format and current clamp recordings
- uses the awesome [pyABF](https://github.com/swharden/pyABF) library for reading ABF files and [eFEL](https://github.com/openbraininstitute/eFEL) for feature extraction
